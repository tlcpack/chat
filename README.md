# Basic Chat App!

To run backend: `python -m uvicorn main:app --reload` from the `api` folder.

To run frontend: `npm run dev` from the `chat-front-end` folder

Unfortauntely, I wasn't able to get this all the way working. Given that a goal was to timebox this for 2 hours, I went ahead and built what I could for the sake of discussion. 

This was my first time using Next, Shad, FastAPI and Websockets. And it has been a few years since I have started a project like this all the way from scratch. I think some of the problems I encountered were likely based in my rustiness in setting up a project from scratch, especially using tech that I've never used before.

I went ahead with adding the CRUD functionality as best I could, keeping in mind that I wasn't able to test much directly. Hopefully this will provide enough for a thoughtful conversation.
